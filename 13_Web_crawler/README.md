## Web Crawler:
A web crawler copies webpages so that they can be processed later by 
the search engine. This allows users of the search engine to find 
webpages quickly. The web crawler also validates links and HTML code, 
and sometimes it extracts other information from the website.
### strip() method:
The strip() method removes any leading (spaces at the beginning) and 
trailing (spaces at the end) characters (space is the default leading 
character to remove).

## urlparse.urljoin(base_url, link):
This method is used to construct a full (“absolute”) URL by combining 
a “base URL” with another URL .

### Note:
- The programms have been tested with python2, python3 on linux.
- Don't misuse the program.
