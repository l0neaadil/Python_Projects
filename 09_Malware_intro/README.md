## Malware:
Malware is any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server, or
computer network.

## smtplib:

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a protocol, which handles sending e-mail and 
routing e-mail between mail servers. Python provides smtplib module, which defines an
SMTP object that can be used to send mail to any Internet machine.

An SMTP object has an instance method called sendmail, which is typically used to do the
work of mailing a message. It takes three parameters −

- The sender − A string with the address of the sender.
- The receivers − A list of strings, one for each recipient.
- The message − Information which is to be mailed.
		
		server.login(sender_email_id, sender_email_password)
		server.sendmail(sender_email_id, receiver_email_id, message)


- starttls() is a command that tells email server that email client wants to turn existing
insecure connection into a secure one.

On the receiver account make sure to give permission for receiving mails from less secure 
apps also.

## requests:

The requests module allows you to send HTTP requests using Python.

requests method:

- get(url): GET method is used to send a GET request to the specified url.

Response object:

When one makes a request to a URL, it returns a response. This Response object in terms
of python is returned by requests.method(), method being – get, post etc. Response is a
powerful object with lots of functions and attributes that assist in normalizing data or
creating ideal portions of code. For example, 
- response.status_code returns the status code from the headers itself, and one can check 
if the request was processed successfully or not.
- response.close() closes the connection to the server.
- response.content returns the content of the response, in bytes.

## tempfile:

The tempfile module defines functions for creating temporary files and directories. 
Under Windows the temp folder resides in "profile/AppData/Local/Temp" while in linux 
the temporary files are held in "/tmp" directory.

Following functions are defined in tempfile module:
- gettempdir(): This function returns location of temp directory storing temporary files.

## os:

The OS module in python provides functions for interacting with the operating system.
Following are some functions in OS module:

- os.getcwd(): Function getcwd() returns the Current Working Directory(CWD)
- os.rmdir('folder_name'): The rmdir() function in the OS module removes the specified directory.
- os.remove('file_name'): The remove() function in the OS module removes the specified file.
- os.chdir('path'):  The chdir() function in the OS module is used for changing current working directory.
- os.path.exists('path'): This method in Python is used to check whether the specified path exists or not.
- os.popen() and os.close(): A file opened using open(), can be closed by close()only. 
But file opened through os.popen(){popen() is similar to open()}, can be closed with close() or os.close(). If we try
closing a file opened with open(), using os.close(), Python would throw TypeError.
 

### Note:
- These programs have been tested on windows with python2.
- Dont misuse the program.
